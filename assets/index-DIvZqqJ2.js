Not wanting this vision to come true, Papa Smurf disallows Clumsy to pick Smurf Roots. Clumsy disobeys Papa and ends up unintentionally leading Gargamel and Azrael to the village. The Smurfs all flee for their lives while Clumsy unknowingly runs towards the Forbidden Falls, with Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Grouchy, Brainy Smurf and Gutsy running after him. They find him at the edge of a cliff, and while trying to help him up, they are sucked into a gigantic vortex that spirits them to present day New York City.

The Smurfs end up in the apartment of Patrick and Grace Winslow, a married and expectant couple, and their Basset Hound Elway. After introducing themselves and explaining their situation, the Winslows befriend them and allow them to stay in their apartment.

Included are Danielle Moonstar aka Mirage, who creates illusions from other people's fears; Rahne Sinclair, who transforms into the werewolf Wolfsbane; Sam Guthrie, who, as Cannonball, can fly at jet speeds protected by a force field; Roberto da Costa aka Sunspot, who absorbs and channels solar power; and Illyana Rasputin aka Magik. The younger sister of Colossus, Magik becomes encased in armor at will and wields a soulsword that amplifies her multiple superhuman and psychic abilities. Invited by Dr. Cecilia Reyes to share their stories about when their powers first manifested, the five "patients" come to understand that they are in a class of people called mutants, who have historically been marginalized and feared. As they relive their origin stories, their memories seem to turn into terrifying realities. Soon, they question what is real and what isn't, and it becomes clear that the institution isn't what it seems. Now the question is – why are they being held captive? And who is trying to destroy them?`,posters:[{comment:"",favorite_count:2,height:1e3,lang:"en",thumb_url:"",type:"poster",url:"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/2599/posters/5f7def9d085a2.jpg",uuid:"62356118",width:680}],release_dates:[],runtime:5640,trailers:[{embeddable:!0,is_featured:!1,language:"en",name:"The New Mutants | Official Trailer | 20th Century FOX",runtime:142,thumb_url:"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W_vJhUAOFpI/sddefault.jpg",type:"trailer",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_vJhUAOFpI",uuid:"162916"}],type:"movie",updated_at:"2024-12-15T20:46:02Z",uuid:"1f49fe0f-f7c4-44b3-945a-f6d2eee30892",series_info:null,keywords:["superhero","mutant","based on comic","superhero team","captivity"],original_language:"en"},extended:{rating_count:0,rating:0,comment_count:0,follower_count:0,is_watched:!0}},{uuid:"5b0db8fe-53f8-484e-80e6-db219eee3685",type:"follow",entity_type:"movie",meta:{fanart:[{comment:"",favorite_count:1,height:1080,lang:"en",thumb_url:"",type:"fanart",url:"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/v4/movie/132/backgrounds/649342be005a4.jpg",uuid:"63540144",width:1920}],first_release_date:"2015-10-16",genres:["Comedy","Science Fiction"],is_released:!0,language:"en",name:"The Martian",overview:"In 2035, the crew of the Ares III space mission is exploring Mars and astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead following a freak fierce storm.

David finds an old camera with a video recording of his seventh birthday party, in which he briefly spots his 17-year-old self in a reflection. Noticing how he appears to be reaching for a basement light switch in the reflection, David and his friends go to the basement, which was forbidden by his father. Underneath a trapdoor activated by the basement switch, the group find the blueprints of a time travel device that Ben was developing named "Project Almanac", and use the available resources to build a functional time machine. David, Christina, Adam, and Quinn later use the battery from the car of David's longtime crush, Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black D'Elia), to charge up the machine, and successfully send a toy car back in time, but blow out the power for the entire neighborhood.

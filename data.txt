Sing, in an attempt to bluff them, throws a firecracker (which he claims is a signal to summon his gangs), which blows up the hat of a minor Axe Gang boss passing by. Sing blames the Pigsty Alley residents for throwing the firecracker. The gang boss attacks a barber, only to be struck by an unseen assailant. The remaining gangs fire the signal to summon more gangs there. Three of the tenants—Coolie, Tailor and Donut—reveal themselves to be Kung Fu masters and triumph over all of the gangs. Fearing the Axe Gang's retaliation, the Landlady quickly evicts the trio.","position_in_franchise":0,"posters":[{"comment":"","favorite_count":0,"height":1000,"lang":"en","thumb_url":"","type":"poster","url":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/2028/posters/2028.jpg","uuid":"2433892","width":680}],"release_dates":[],"runtime":8700,"sorting":null,"status":"","tagline":"","trailers":[],"translations":[],"type":"movie","updated_at":"2024-05-27T05:06:07Z","uuid":"11c8d811-ef84-4639-ae56-0d42bafd5a48"},"extended":{"rating_count":0,"rating":0,"comment_count":0,"follower_count":0,"is_watched":true},"filter":["watched"],"sorting":[{"value":"2022-02-20T01:24:28Z","id":"follow_date"},{"value":"Kung Fu Hustle","id":"name"},{"value":"2022-02-20T01:24:29Z","id":"watched_date"}]},{"uuid":"367e1269-4e8e-4e79-80a0-5246091803cf","type":"follow","entity_type":"movie","created_at":"2022-02-20T01:22:17Z","updated_at":"2022-02-20T01:22:17Z","watched_at":"2022-02-20T01:22:18Z","meta":{"character_order":"","characters":[],"created_at":"2024-05-26T21:38:25Z","external_sources":[{"id":"131147","source":"tvdb","type":"external_source"}],"fanart":[{"comment":"","favorite_count":4,"height":1080,"lang":"en","thumb_url":"","type":"fanart","url":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/131147/backgrounds/5ec148052dbe8.jpg","uuid":"62195593","width":1920}],"filter":[],"first_release_date":"2021-11-04","follower_count":0,"franchise":{"name":"","type":"franchise","uuid":""},"genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"is_released":true,"language":"en","name":"Eternals","overview":"Marvel Studios' Eternals welcomes an exciting new team of Super Heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The younger sister of Colossus, Magik becomes encased in armor at will and wields a soulsword that amplifies her multiple superhuman and psychic abilities. Invited by Dr. Cecilia Reyes to share their stories about when their powers first manifested, the five \"patients\" come to understand that they are in a class of people called mutants, who have historically been marginalized and feared. As they relive their origin stories, their memories seem to turn into terrifying realities.

David finds an old camera with a video recording of his seventh birthday party, in which he briefly spots his 17-year-old self in a reflection. Noticing how he appears to be reaching for a basement light switch in the reflection, David and his friends go to the basement, which was forbidden by his father. Underneath a trapdoor activated by the basement switch, the group find the blueprints of a time travel device that Ben was developing named \"Project Almanac\", and use the available resources to build a functional time machine. David, Christina, Adam, and Quinn later use the battery from the car of David's longtime crush, Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black D'Elia), to charge up the machine, and successfully send a toy car back in time, but blow out the power for the entire neighborhood.

David finds an old camera with a video recording of his seventh birthday party, in which he briefly spots his 17-year-old self in a reflection. Noticing how he appears to be reaching for a basement light switch in the reflection, David and his friends go to the basement, which was forbidden by his father. Underneath a trapdoor activated by the basement switch, the group find the blueprints of a time travel device that Ben was developing named \"Project Almanac\", and use the available resources to build a functional time machine. David, Christina, Adam, and Quinn later use the battery from the car of David's longtime crush, Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black D'Elia), to charge up the machine, and successfully send a toy car back in time, but blow out the power for the entire neighborhood.

Providence appears on the scene to stop the rift, but are unable to do anything before Rex arrives with Six and Bobo. Doctor Holiday, scientist and love interest of Agent Six, then gets a scan that shows something is coming through the rift, and Rex finds himself (unknowingly) fighting against Ben Tennyson, in the form of Humungousaur. During their skirmish, a strange metallic creature also appears and heads into the city, with Bobo and Six on its trail. Continuting their fight across New York, Ben switches to Diamondhead, Lodestar and finally Rath as Rex continues to try curing him; an annoyed Ben demands Rex stop as he doesn't even know what an EVO is. Changing back to human form, Ben is shocked that no one has heard of him despite being a celebrity. Then, Six appears with the creature, which self-destructs and renders him comatose, leaving Rex mortified and angered at Ben.","position_in_franchise":0,"posters":[{"comment":"","favorite_count":0,"height":1000,"lang":"en","thumb_url":"","type":"poster","url":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/40843/posters/40843.jpg","uuid":"2456449","width":680}],"release_dates":[],"runtime":2760,"sorting":null,"status":"","tagline":"","trailers":[],"translations":[],"type":"movie","updated_at":"2024-05-27T02:45:32Z","uuid":"2514254e-33cc-4a47-ac4b-b93456af0d2b"},"extended":{"rating_count":0,"rating":0,"comment_count":0,"follower_count":0,"is_watched":true},"filter":["watched"],"sorting":[{"value":"2022-04-16T18:57:14Z","id":"follow_date"},{"value":"Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United","id":"name"},{"value":"2022-04-16T18:57:14Z","id":"watched_date"}]},{"uuid":"1b797503-88d1-49f0-825a-70915c42cf5e","type":"follow","entity_type":"movie","created_at":"2022-03-21T17:29:03Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T17:29:03Z","watched_at":"2022-03-21T17:29:03Z","meta":{"character_order":"","characters":[],"created_at":"2024-05-27T05:11:23Z","external_sources":[{"id":"631","source":"tvdb","type":"external_source"}],"fanart":[{"comment":"","favorite_count":0,"height":1080,"lang":"en","thumb_url":"","type":"fanart","url":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/631/backgrounds/631.jpg","uuid":"2579031","width":1920}],"filter":[],"first_release_date":"2014-07-16","follower_count":0,"franchise":{"name":"","type":"franchise","uuid":""},"genres":["Action","Adventure","Science Fiction"],"is_released":true,"language":"en","name":"Transformers: Age of Extinction","overview":"Five years after Chicago was destroyed, humans have turned against all robots.

Sing, in an attempt to bluff them, throws a firecracker (which he claims is a signal to summon his gangs), which blows up the hat of a minor Axe Gang boss passing by. Sing blames the Pigsty Alley residents for throwing the firecracker. The gang boss attacks a barber, only to be struck by an unseen assailant. The remaining gangs fire the signal to summon more gangs there. Three of the tenants—Coolie, Tailor and Donut—reveal themselves to be Kung Fu masters and triumph over all of the gangs. Fearing the Axe Gang's retaliation, the Landlady quickly evicts the trio.","position_in_franchise":0,"posters":[{"comment":"","favorite_count":0,"height":1000,"lang":"en","thumb_url":"","type":"poster","url":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/2028/posters/2028.jpg","uuid":"2433892","width":680}],"release_dates":[],"runtime":8700,"sorting":null,"status":"","tagline":"","trailers":[],"translations":[],"type":"movie","updated_at":"2024-05-27T05:06:07Z","uuid":"11c8d811-ef84-4639-ae56-0d42bafd5a48"},"extended":{"rating_count":0,"rating":0,"comment_count":0,"follower_count":0,"is_watched":true},"filter":["watched"],"sorting":[{"value":"2022-02-20T01:24:28Z","id":"follow_date"},{"value":"Kung Fu Hustle","id":"name"},{"value":"2022-02-20T01:24:29Z","id":"watched_date"}]},{"uuid":"367e1269-4e8e-4e79-80a0-5246091803cf","type":"follow","entity_type":"movie","created_at":"2022-02-20T01:22:17Z","updated_at":"2022-02-20T01:22:17Z","watched_at":"2022-02-20T01:22:18Z","meta":{"character_order":"","characters":[],"created_at":"2024-05-26T21:38:25Z","external_sources":[{"id":"131147","source":"tvdb","type":"external_source"}],"fanart":[{"comment":"","favorite_count":4,"height":1080,"lang":"en","thumb_url":"","type":"fanart","url":"https://artworks.thetvdb.com/banners/movies/131147/backgrounds/5ec148052dbe8.jpg","uuid":"62195593","width":1920}],"filter":[],"first_release_date":"2021-11-04","follower_count":0,"franchise":{"name":"","type":"franchise","uuid":""},"genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"is_released":true,"language":"en","name":"Eternals","overview":"Marvel Studios' Eternals welcomes an exciting new team of Super Heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The younger sister of Colossus, Magik becomes encased in armor at will and wields a soulsword that amplifies her multiple superhuman and psychic abilities. Invited by Dr. Cecilia Reyes to share their stories about when their powers first manifested, the five \"patients\" come to understand that they are in a class of people called mutants, who have historically been marginalized and feared. As they relive their origin stories, their memories seem to turn into terrifying realities.
